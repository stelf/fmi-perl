Practical Perl Programming at FMI/Sofia University

The lectures title Practicle Perl Programming (PPP) have been going since 2003 in Sofia University (Bulgarian State University). These were initially published via custom web pages that have long gone offline, and later via Moodle used by the faculty of math and science.

The team hasfinally understood the need to collect all our examples and make them publicly available on GitHub. There are still  many snippets waiting for review and upload, but it's a start. We hope this repo will eventually become if not comprehensive, at least a fairly complete set of Perl5 related tutorials.

Best,

Your PPP Team :camel:
