Practical Perl Programming at FMI/Sofia University

The lectures title Practicle Perl Programming (PPP) have been going since 2003 in Sofia University (Bulgarian State University).
We've finally understood the need to collect all our examples and publish them on GitHub. There are way more snippets to upload here, but eventually this we hope this repo to become if not comprehensive, at least a fairly complete set of Perl5 related tutorials.

Best,
Your PPP Team
