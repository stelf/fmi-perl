1. Task
  An AnyEvent server which listens for incoming client messages and local user
  input.

  The client messages will be of the form:
    [type] [arg1] [arg2] [...]
    Where [type] is the type of operation and [argN] is the Nth argument to
    that operation.
    An example operation could be:
      add 2 2 -> Returns the sum of its arguments
      print hello -> Echoes back its arguments

  The local messages will be single-word commands:
    stop -> stops the AnyEvent server from listening from clients
    start -> starts the AnyEvent server to listen to clients
    restart -> restarts the AnyEvent server
